This is for me to remeber :) you can skip steps 1-3 

1. In the terminal, run go mod init <appname> to initialize a new module.
2. Create a file named main.go in your project folder
3. In main.go, we will write the code for our application.

4. In the terminal, run 

    ```bash
    go run main.go 
    ```

5. To compile the program.
    
        ```bash
        go build main.go
        ```

6. It will create <appname>.exe file in project folder.
7. Run the <appname>.exe file to see the output.
